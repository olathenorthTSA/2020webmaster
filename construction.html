		<h2> Introduction to Technology Education </h2>
		<p> This class will introduce students to Engineering Design, Architectural Design and Production / Manufacturing Technology. Students will learn fundamentals of 
			manufacturing and construction technology, create computer-aided drawings, production of prototypes, as well as research historical and future technology issues.</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "course">
		<h2> Production Technology I </h2>
		<p> This course is designed to instruct students utilizing project-oriented activites related to the construction industry, manufacturing, materials, and their processes.
			Activities include team problem solving / projects, individual projects, introductory manufacturing processes, and CNC technology. Students work with either woods,
			metals, plastics, or electricity in mass production and individual design activities. Students will be introduced to CAD software for developing products.</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "course">
		<h2> Production Technology II </h2>
		<p> Students study various methods used to process and transform materials including skills common to all manufacturing occupations such as construction document reading,
			safety, hand and power tools, bonding, advanced joinery, forming, CNC and CAD. CAD software will be used to create projects throughout the entire semester. </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "course"> 
		<h2> Research & Design for Pre-Construction I </h2>
		<p>Students enrolled in this course will use advanced design / communication principles to create real - world projects or simulations. Projects will include professional
			client communication, covering specific topics in design and pre-construction to include management and "green design" skills. Students will work collaboratively
			focusing on the design process and team efficiencies. Teaming models such as Six Sigma will be applied to develop highly efficent production techniques. Skills learned
			in this class will help them to become highly competent design professionals. </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "course">
		<h2> Research & Design for Pre-Construction II </h2>
		<p> Students in this advanced class will work with a client to develop a client driven product. They will produce a presentation and construction drawings as well as a
		working prototype (graphic or physical) using advanced software and / or equipment. Researching new technologies to meet future client needs will take place, covering 
		specific topics in design and construction to include management and "green design" skills. Students will develop abilities in design / planning and visual communication
		in current architectural practices. Students will manipulate materials and design / manufacturing and construction processes to meet client needs with set project goals
		and timeslines. </p>
